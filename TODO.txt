- add Tox to test agains multiple python & django versions
- shoult it have a dummy views/urls/views file, for testing purposes?
- setup logger
- this lib expects only RS256... THIS IS BAD!
- override gen_nonce method from settings (is it necessary?)
- check Nonce.generate to only retry up to a maximum (5?)
- add DYNAMIC REGISTRATION later
- change Nonce.hash to Nonce.state
- add "?next=" to Nonce, to remember where the user should be redirected
- verify uniqueness of email, preferred_username, etc.
- find a way to subscribe email, profile, username, etc. (maybe custom?)
- check for INtegrityError on OpenIDUser+userModel
- add ability to insert custom verifying methods (really?)
- record id_token_signing_alg_values_supported in OpenIDProvider,
and make #signing_keys return the proper keyset (RS256, HS256, etc)


- change oidc_settings.CLIENT_ID to provider.client_id(secret)
